I am a first year PhD student at the
[[https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl][Mobile Robotics Lab]] at McGill
University and [[https://www.mila.quebec][Mila]] in Montreal, Canada. I
am fortunately supervised by [[https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dmeger][David
Meger]] and [[http://www.marcgbellemare.info/][Marc G. Bellemare]].

My research interests are primarily concerned with reinforcement
learning, and particularly with methods of modeling uncertainty to
improve safety and exploration. I am a
[[https://www.distributional-rl.org][distributional reinforcement
learning]] enthusiast.

During my Master's, I derived a characterization
of the distribution of returns induced by agents whose dynamics are
driven by continuous-time Markov processes, which we used to analyze
continuous time distributional RL algorithms. My thesis can be seen
[[./assets/thesis-msc.pdf][here]].
