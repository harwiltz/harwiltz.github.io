I am a PhD student at
[[https://mcgill.ca][McGill University]] and [[https://www.mila.quebec][Mila]] in Montreal, Canada. I
am fortunately supervised by [[http://marcgbellemare.info][Marc G. Bellemare]] and [[https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dmeger][David
Meger]].

My research interests are primarily concerned with reinforcement
learning, and particularly with methods of modeling uncertainty to
improve safety and exploration. I am a
[[https://www.distributional-rl.org][distributional reinforcement
learning]] enthusiast.

During my Master's, I derived a characterization
of the distribution of returns induced by agents whose dynamics are
driven by continuous-time Markov processes, which we used to analyze
continuous time distributional RL algorithms. My thesis can be seen
[[./assets/thesis-msc.pdf][here]].
